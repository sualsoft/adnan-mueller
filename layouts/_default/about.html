          <h3>Who I am</h3>
          <h2>Saira Mueller is a journalist, proofreader, moderator, and presenter based in New York City.</h2>
          <p>
            Since relocating to the U.S. from Australia in 2014, Saira has worked for a number of publications 
            across topics—although her specialty is in health and technology journalism. She has moderated panels 
            at some of the world’s biggest conferences, including SXSW and the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, 
            as well as presenting awards and hosting shows.
          </p>
          <p>
            While she started her journalism career in print (newspapers and magazines) in 2012, Saira has become 
            adept at online media and prefers to write and edit for the web and social media. She spends most of 
            her time tracking her sleep, mood, habits, fitness, and health. When she’s not doing that she’s in a 
            sensory deprivation tank, playing with her dog, and traveling the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           Saira has a Masters in Journalism from Columbia University and holds Australian and German citizenship 
            alongside her U.S. green card.
          </p>
          <p>
          With a passion for helping people to be the best version of themselves; building strong, happy teams; 
            optimizing workflows; and the Oxford comma (with em-dashes being a close second), Saira is the perfect 
            addition to your team, project, proofreading, or editing job.
          </p>
             <p>
